You can modify it using the Art of Illusion program (http://www.artofillusion.org - GPLv2).

Quick guide to Art of Illusion
==============================

	* Install Art of Illusion (AUR package for Archlinux, or from its 
	  website, following the Download page).
	* Launch Art of Illusion, by using the Applications Menu or the "aoi" 
	  command.
	* Go to File»Open..., and pick the scene.aoi file from this directory.
	* You will see the scene in the four windows on the screen.
	* Go to Scene»Render..., choose your definition, set Antialiasing to
	  the maximum, and check the three checkboxes below this option. If you
	  want the blur to be more accurate (less noisy), increase the value in
	  Pixel Max and Pixel Min.
	* Click "Render". You can now go out or do what you want, you have time.
	* Once the rendering is finished (it appears step by step in a window), 
	  click "Save", select the format you want, then click Ok. Enter a name
	  for the file and click Save.

You have now a nice image of the scene. The manual of Art of Illusion is a bit
outdated but still useful, as the vast majority of the recent changes in this
program are in the UI, not the features.

Official quality rendering settings :

	* Width : 2134
	* Height : 1200 (with these big dimensions, one rendering can do the
	  1920x1080, 1600x1200 and 1920x1200 without loosing informations or
	  the aspect ratio)
	* Max Pixels : 1024
	* Min Pixels : 8
	* Anti Aliasing set to Maximum
	* The three checkboxes are checked
	* In More : Max reflection depth set to 16
	* In More : Lower geometry for far objects set to No

These settings take nearly seven hours to render on a 1,2Ghz AMD L110.
